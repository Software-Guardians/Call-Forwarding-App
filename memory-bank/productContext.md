# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Users often work on their PCs with headphones on and miss calls or find it cumbersome to switch context to their phone to answer/make calls. Existing solutions may be platform-locked (like Phone Link) or lack specific "gamer/cyberpunk" aesthetics and control.

## Solution

A distinct, highly stylized PC application that integrates deeply with the user's desktop workflow, allowing them to remain focused on their screen while managing their communication needs.

## User Experience Goals

- **"Aura" Aesthetic**: The app should feel like a piece of sci-fi technology (`#0A1128` background, Neon Cyan accents).
- **Seamless**: Connection should be automatic or one-click.
- **Non-intrusive**: Incoming calls should appear as sleek overlays, not stealing focus aggressively but being noticeable.
- **Responsive**: Immediate feedback for all actions (dialing, answering).

## Functional Capabilities

- **Scan & Connect**: Find the Android "Server" app.
- **Receive Calls**: Pop-up notification => Answer/Reject.
- **Make Calls**: Dialpad and Contact search.
- **In-Call**: Mute, Hangup, Audio visualization.
- **Contacts**: Fetch and display phone contacts.
